/*
 * Title: SpiComPortInitialization
 *
 * Objective:
 *    This example demonstrates how to configure a COM port for use with an
 *    SPI device.
 *
 * Description:
 *    This example will explain the basic configuration settings of an SPI
 *    device then perform a brief transaction with the SPI device connected to
 *    COM-0.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * ** An SPI device connected to COM-0.

// Select the baud rate to match the target device.
#define baudRate 80000

// Select the clock polarity to match the target device. The clock polarity
// setting indicates whether the device expects a low signal when idle or a
// high signal when idle. It also indicates whether the leading or trailing
// edge of the clock cycle are rising or falling edges.
// Selecting SCK_LOW indicates that SCK is low when idle and the leading edge
// of the clock cycle is a rising edge while the trailing edge is a falling
// edge.
// Selecting SCK_HIGH indicates that SCK is high when idle and the leading edge
// of the clock cycle is a falling edge while the trailing edge is a rising
// edge.
// The default value for a COM connector's clock polarity is SCK_LOW.
#define clockPolarity SerialDriver::SCK_LOW

// Select the clock phase setting to match the target device. The clock phase
// setting indicates whether data is sampled or changed on the leading or
// trailing edge in the clock cycle.
// Selecting LEAD_SAMPLE indicates that data is sampled on the leading edge and
// changed on the trailing edge.
// Selecting LEAD_CHANGE indicates that data is sampled on the trailing edge
// and changed on the leading edge.
// The default value for a COM connector's clock phase is LEAD_CHANGE.
#define clockPhase SerialDriver::LEAD_CHANGE
