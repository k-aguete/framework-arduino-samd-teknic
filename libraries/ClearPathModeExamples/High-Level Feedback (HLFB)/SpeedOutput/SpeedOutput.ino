/*
 * Title: SpeedOutput
 *
 * Objective:
 *    This example demonstrates how to configure and read-in the High-Level
 *    Feedback mode "Speed Output" of a ClearPath motor.
 *
 *    This HLFB mode is available in ClearPath-MC series servos, in every
 *    ClearPath-MC operational mode except Ramp Up/Down to Selected Velocity.
 *
 * Description:
 *    This example reads the state of an attached ClearPath motor's HLFB output
 *    when configured for "Speed Output". During operation, the state of HLFB
 *    and calculated measured speed are written to the USB serial port.
 *
 *    This example does not enable the motor or command motion. Use the
 *    "Override Inputs" feature in MSP to command motion and see changes in the
 *    HLFB measurement.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. A ClearPath motor must be connected to Connector M-0.
 * 2.  The connected ClearPath motor must be configured through the MSP software
 *    for an operational mode compatible with Speed Output HLFB mode (see above)
 * 3. The connected ClearPath motor must have its HLFB mode set to "Speed Output"
 *    (select Advanced>>High Level Feedback [Mode]... then choose "Speed Output"
 *    from the dropdown and hit the OK button).
 *    Select a 482 Hz PWM Carrier Frequency in this menu.
