/*
 * Title: InputInterrupts
 *
 * Objective:
 *    This example demonstrates how to configure a digital interrupt on a
 *    ClearCore input.
 *
 * Description:
 *    This example sets up and attaches a callback function to be triggered by
 *    a digital interrupt. Interrupts are useful when a function needs to be
 *    called asynchronously from the rest of the code's execution.
 *
 *    This example's interrupt blinks the on-board user LED when the interrupt
 *    pin goes from on to off (aka "falling"). You may notice multiple blinks
 *    depending on how much bounce the input device has.
 *
 *    The interrupt callback function's ability to run is turned on and off
 *    periodically by this example. The callback function can only run when
 *    interrupts are turned "on", regardless of the interrupt pin state. If the
 *    interrupt pin is triggered while interrupts are "off", the callback will
 *    execute when interrupts are next turned on. This on/off state is printed
 *    to the USB serial port.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * ** A digital signal source, such as a switch or sensor, connected to DI-6 to
 *    trigger the interrupt
