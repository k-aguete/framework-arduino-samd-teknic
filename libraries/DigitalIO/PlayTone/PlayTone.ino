/*
 * Title: PlayTone
 *
 * Objective:
 *    This example demonstrates how to play a sequence of tones on the
 *    ClearCore's H-Bridge connectors using the musical frequency values defined
 *    in the pitches.h header file.
 *
 * Description:
 *    This example sets up an H-Bridge connector into output mode, sets the
 *    volume, and plays a melodic sequence of tones of equal duration.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * ** A speaker or other audio output device connected to IO-4
 *
