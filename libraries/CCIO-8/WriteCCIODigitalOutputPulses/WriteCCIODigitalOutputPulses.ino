/*
 * Title: WriteCCIODigitalOutputPulses
 *
 * Objective:
 *    This example demonstrates how to initialize a CCIO-8 Expansion Board and
 *    write digital pulses to its outputs.
 *
 * Description:
 *    This example sets up COM-0 to control a CCIO-8 Expansion Board then
 *    writes a series of digital pulses to the defined connector.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * ** A CCIO-8 Expansion Board powered and connected to COM-0
 * ** An output such as an LED connected to defined connector (CCIO-0)
 *      Note: You can leave the I/O point disconnected and still see the
 *      built-in I/O LED toggle with the connector state.
